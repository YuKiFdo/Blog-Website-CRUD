# Posts Management Application

A simple web application built with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** that allows users to view, search, and manage posts. This application features a **dashboard** that lists all posts, displays detailed content, and allows for filtering posts by their title. Users can also navigate to an edit page (if available) to modify posts.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the front-end of the application.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, routing, and other essential features for building React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application with a custom design.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used to fetch data from an API endpoint.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The language used for implementing logic and interactivity.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and autocompletion for better development experience.

## Features

- **Posts Listing**: Displays a list of all posts with their titles, content previews, and creation dates.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to filter posts by title as they type in the search bar.
- **Post Details**: Clicking on a post redirects the user to the post's detailed page.
- **Back to Dashboard**: Provides a button to return to the dashboard.
- **Edit Button (Optional)**: An edit button on each post that could take the user to an edit page (if implemented).

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v16.x or higher)
- **npm** (or **yarn**) for package management
- A **backend API** endpoint for fetching posts (can be adjusted to point to any REST API)
